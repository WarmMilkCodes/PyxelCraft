# Description
PyxelCraft started as a minimalistic engine to render a single chunk of colored voxels, offering the groundwork for more advanced features. The core is designed to be modular, so features can be added or modified without disrupting the foundation.

# Features
- Simple Rendering: Render a chunk of colored voxels with ease.
- Player Input: Move the chunk using arrow keys.
- Basic Camera Controls: A rudimentary camera using OpenGL's gluLookAt.

# Future Goals
1. Dynamic World Generation: Seamless integration of multiple chunks for larger worlds.
2. Advanced Camera: Responsive controls for improved player experience.
3. Voxel Modification: Tools for players to change the world in real-time.
4. Improved Rendering: Introducing textures, shading, and lighting for a more realistic look.
5. Networking: Multiplayer capabilities for collaborative gameplay.
